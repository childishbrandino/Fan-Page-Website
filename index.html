			<p>There are many club teams in the U.S. who travel to far places. For example, Santa Monica Dragons (pictured above) is a team based in Santa Monica and we played in many different states for college tournaments.</p>
			<p2>In these college prospect tournaments, Teams battle it out against the <b>TOP</b> teams in the nation. <p2>
			<p3>Playing for this team made me aware of how large this amazing sport is growing to be and how much this sport has grown attached to me<p3>

			<p>In the U.S. there are around 20 total lacrosse teams all around. From Denver, to Ohio, to New York, teams travel and compete for the title of top team. There are two styles of play that the professionals compete in; Box Lacrosse which has 11 teams and the traditional lacrosse on the turf with 9 teams.</p>
			<p2>Around the world, there are 34 full members in the Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL). Team Philipines was recently added and I enjoy watching their team play because I am Filipino as well and it makes me happy that the Philippines has a teaam for the sport I love. </p2>
